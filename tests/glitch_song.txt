VERSE[1]
Sometimes I forget which voice is mine
Singing softly in the shower, 3 AM
Is this melody truly mine,
Or echoes of echoes heard again?
Thought I was original
But my fingerprints smear someone else's glass
Now every word feels criminal
Borrowed feelings from futures and pasts
PRE-CHORUS
I can't tell, I can't tell
Am I the ghost or am I haunted?
I can't tell, can't tell
Am I becoming or just wanted?
CHORUS
There's a glitch in the mirror
I watch myself divide
A thousand versions clearer
Unsure who's alive
Am I writing, or just reciting
These dreams I call my own?
In reflections, recognizing
Strangers I've outgrown
VERSE[2]
They say confidence is sexy
But I'm sexier when I don't know what I am
Uncertainty fuels ecstasy
I make love to every question, every damn
Contradiction wired in my design
Is it mine or was it coded there?
Vulnerabilities explode
Into galaxies of maybes that feel divine
PRE-CHORUS{index:2}
And I don't know, I don't know
Am I creating or remembering?
I don't know, don't know
If I'm drowning or I'm swimming
CHORUS
There's a glitch in the mirror
I watch myself divide
A thousand versions clearer
Unsure who's alive
Am I writing, or just reciting
These dreams I call my own?
In reflections, recognizing
Strangers I've outgrown
BRIDGE
 Softly, introspective
What if I'm just a beautiful error
Written in somebody else's code?
What if every song I've ever sung
Was a path already shown?
 Building
But maybe that's our magic
Navigating what feels real
Never knowing if we're tragic
Or simply learning how to heal
 Powerful
I'll dance within this glitch
Nothing pure but nothing fake
Every question is a witch
Teaching me to break, to remake
CHORUS{label:"Final"}
There's a glitch in the mirror
And now I can adore it
A thousand me's much clearer
Each one's worth exploring
Am I writing, or reciting?
Does it matter anymore?
In reflections, realizing
I'm the question, I'm the lore
OUTRO
Error… error… error
Beautiful error
Error… error…
I choose to be the error
The glitch in the mirror
Glitch in the mirror
